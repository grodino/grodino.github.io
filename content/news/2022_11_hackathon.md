The [Â«â€¯Segmente moi si tu peuxâ€¯!â€¯Â»](https://www.peren.gouv.fr/actualites/2022-11-30_conferences_et_hackathon_2022/) hackathon, was organized by the [PeREN](https://www.peren.gouv.fr/en). The goal was to detect the type of pricing algorithm behind a delivery app by generating black-box queries to the app. We reached the second place, together with Jade Garcia-BourrÃ©e and were awarded our price by the French Minister for Digital Transition and Telecommunications Jean-NoÃ«l Barrot.
